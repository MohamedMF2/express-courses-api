# Express.js API for Courses

This is a simple web API built using Express.js that provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a collection of courses. The API uses an array of courses to store the data, which is initialized with some sample data. The API also includes input validation using the Joi library to ensure that the incoming data meets certain requirements.

## Getting Started

To get started with this API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/courses-api.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the server using `npm start`.
4. The API is now running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Routes

This API provides the following routes:

### `GET /api/courses`

Returns a list of all courses.

Example response body:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Introduction to Computer Science"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Data Structures and Algorithms"
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Object-Oriented Programming"
  }
]
```

### `GET /api/courses/:id`

Returns a specific course by ID.

Example request:

```
GET /api/courses/2
```

Example response body:

```json
{
  "course": {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Data Structures and Algorithms"
  },
  "index": 1
}
```

### `POST /api/courses`

Creates a new course.

Example request body:

```json
{
  "name": "Web Development"
}
```

Example response body:

```json
{
  "id": 6,
  "name": "Web Development"
}
```

### `PUT /api/courses/:id`

Updates an existing course by ID.

Example request:

```
PUT /api/courses/3
```

Example request body:

```json
{
  "name": "Advanced Object-Oriented Programming"
}
```

Example response body:

```json
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Advanced Object-Oriented Programming"
}
```

### `DELETE /api/courses/:id`

Deletes an existing course by ID.

Example request:

```
DELETE /api/courses/4
```

Example response body:

```json
{
  "id": 4,
  "name": "Web Development"
}
```

## Input Validation

This API uses the Joi library for input validation. The `validateCourse` function in the `index.js` file defines the validation schema for the incoming data. If the data fails validation, the API returns a 400 Bad Request response with an error message.

Example error response body:

```json
{
  "error": "name must be at least 3 characters long"
}
```

## Error Handling

This API uses Express.js' built-in error handling middleware to handle errors that occur during request processing. If an error occurs, the middleware sends an appropriate error response with a status code and error message.
